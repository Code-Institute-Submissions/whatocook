# The UX

## Testing

### Store (Add) a recipe
* I have tried and friends by using different devices and screens (see devices below) to add more than one recipe and it works and were added to the whatocook database collection recipes without any error.

### Edit a recipe
* I have tried and friends by using different devices and screens to edit a recipe by changing it recipes and re save it to the database, a friend point out the data was not retrieving from the database, which are: Ingredients,
Preparation Steps and Required Tools. This we resolved by adding recipes collection and field name: 
```
{{recipe.ingredients}}
{{recipe.preparation_steps}}
{{recipe.required_tools}}
```
In addtion of cuisine was return null value when the user dose not re select it, this was fixed by disbley the current cuisine by added selected to the current cuisine value.
Also, redirect to get_recipes was not working. Deitals below in the (Redirect after Adding Editing and Deleting).
### Delete a recipe
* I tried  and friends by using different devices and screens to delete a recipe from the database and delete a cuisine and it was deleted from the database collections with no error, but redirect to get_recipes was not working. 
Deitals below in the (Redirect after Adding Editing and Deleting).

### Search for recipe
* I have tried and friends by using different devices and screens (see devices below) to search for more than one recipe by it's cuisines or recipes name, search function did not display match list of recipes when search by cuisine.
Found mismatch in search_cuisine vs search_by_cuisine in recipebycuisine.html {% for recipe in search_cuisine %}. 
For user convenient, upper method was added when cuisine is added to match search input.
Also have added print() to print the search out come. Tested by search for all recipes as French cuisine, all recipes related to that cuisine was listed successfully. Aslo, by recipes name, and it was listed successfully.

### Redirect after Adding Editing and Deleting
* After were a recipe / cuisine added editied or deleted, the app was not redirect to get_recipe page, insted was showing error (the site can't be reached) - bug fixed: re-set host to 0.0.0.0 and remove PORT 3000 for redirects to work. 
Tested by Edit a recipe, and the app successfully redirected to get_recipe page (Main page).
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0',
            port=(os.environ.get('PORT')),
            debug=True)
```
### Full width background and about
Background was giving 100% width, and the text was centre by using flex box. By giving relative position to the background and absolute position to the text, text is responsive at the centre of the background image across all screen sizes. 
This was tested by testing it on different screen sizes.

### Devices Tested
* Galaxy s5
* iPhone 6/7/8
* iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
* iPhone X
* iPad
* Desktop MacBook Pro

* Browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Also, Chrome Dev Tools: I used Chrome Tools to run test my code and debugging it through out the coding and building the application. Also, try texting different screen sizes.

### Code validator
* HTML: I ran html code on w3 html validator:
1. Warning: Consider adding a lang attribute to the html start tag to declare the language of this document. Been modified accordingly.
2. Error: Bad value {{url_for('static',filename='css/style.css')}} for attribute href on element link: Illegal character in path segment: { is not allowed.
3. Warning: The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources.Been modified accordingly.

* CSS: I ran html code on w3 validator No Error Found.

* Javascript: I ran html code on codebeautify.org/jsvalidate No Error Found.

* Python3: Checked app.py code for [PEP8](http://pep8online.com) requirements. 

## Deployment

### To Github
1. Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, I did not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. I added these files after my project has been pushed to GitHub.
2. Open Terminal on MacBook Pro.
3. Change the current working directory to my local project.
4. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository, by:
  ```
  git init
  ```
5. Added the files in my new local repository. This stages them for the first commit, by:
```
$ git add fileName
```
6. Commit the files that I have staged in my local repository, by:
```
$ git commit -m "First commit"
```
7. At the top of my GitHub repository's, I copy the remote repository URL.
8. In Terminal, added the URL for the remote repository where my local repository will be pushed, by:
```
$ git remote add origin remote https://github.com/Tariqalrehily/whatocook
```
9. Push the changes in my local repository to GitHub Master branch, by:
```
$ git push -u origin master
```

* After, I will do this to commit and push my projects changes and keep my GitHub repository up to date.

### From Github
* To run this one page app locally:
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.
4. Open Terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2. URL (https://github.com/Tariqalrehily/whatocook)
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

### Deploy To Heroku
There are four things needed in order to push our code to Heroku.
1. Create a requirements.txt file, which contains a list of our dependencies.
2. Create a Procfile, which tells Heroku how to run our project. By adding web: python app.py to the file and including it in our deployment
3. Created a Heroku whatocook app.
4. Linked the local Git repository to Heroku to enable auto deployment. 
5. Choose bransh (master) and start depolying. [whatocook link](https://whatocook.herokuapp.com/)
